## Step 8: Add Order Management Micro-Frontend

- Created `apps/orders` micro-frontend with its own React app, Webpack config, and CSS.
- Added static order data to `shared/staticData.js` with multiple statuses and customer info.
- Implemented Kanban-style order pipeline UI in Orders app.
- Integrated Orders app into shell navigation and module federation config.


## Step 9: Add Analytics Dashboard Micro-Frontend

- Created `apps/analytics` micro-frontend with React, Webpack, Babel, and Module Federation config
- Added static analytics data to `shared/staticData.js`
- Built `AnalyticsDashboard` component with sales metrics, customer insights, and A/B test results
- Integrated analytics remote into shell's Module Federation config
- Added Analytics Dashboard to shell navigation and dynamic loading


## Step 10: Add Error Boundaries and Offline Support

- Implemented `ErrorBoundary` component in shell for robust error handling
- Wrapped shell app content in `ErrorBoundary`
- Added basic Service Worker (`public/service-worker.js`) for offline support
- Registered service worker in shell's `index.jsx`


## Step 11: Formalize Provider Pattern for Tenant Context

- Created `TenantProvider` and `TenantContext` in `shared/TenantContext.js`
- Updated shell app to use `TenantProvider` and context for tenant switching
- All tenant state and switching logic now uses React context for scalability and maintainability


---

-  Next: Polish, test, and document final steps.
+ Final polish: All apps tested for navigation, tenant switching, and UI consistency.
	Micro-frontends load independently and share static data as required.
	All requirements for modularity, user-friendliness, and maintainability are met.

## Project Complete

- The project is now a fully documented, modular, micro-frontend React platform with static data, user-friendly UI, and clear separation of concerns.
- All steps, decisions, and code organization are explained in this file for future reference and onboarding.
-  Next: Integrate micro-frontends into the shell and add navigation between them.
+ Integrated Storefront and Catalog micro-frontends into the shell app using Module Federation.
	Added navigation bar for switching between micro-frontends and tenant context.
	All UI uses CSS files for styling. The shell loads each micro-frontend dynamically and displays them in a unified, user-friendly interface.
	Next: Polish, test, and document final steps.
-  Both apps consume shared static data and use clean, accessible layouts and color schemes.
+  Both apps now use separate CSS files for styling, improving maintainability and scalability.
	All inline styles have been refactored to CSS classes.
-  Next: Build UI for Storefront and Catalog micro-frontends to consume and display static data.
+ Implemented user-friendly, modern UI for Storefront (drag-and-drop demo, action buttons) and Catalog (styled product table) micro-frontends.
	Both apps consume shared static data and use clean, accessible layouts and color schemes.
	Next: Integrate micro-frontends into the shell and add navigation between them.
-  Next: Build basic UI components to display and interact with this data.
+ Implemented basic Shell UI with tenant switching dropdown and display of current tenant info.
	Next: Build UI for Storefront and Catalog micro-frontends to consume and display static data.
- Add static data files and basic UI components for tenants, products, and navigation.
+ Added `shared/staticData.js` with example tenants, products, and orders.
	This file will be imported by all apps to simulate backend data.
	Next: Build basic UI components to display and interact with this data.
## Step 7: Implement Static Data and User-Friendly UI

- Begin implementing static data and building user-friendly, modern UIs for each app as per requirements.
- Each step and design decision will be documented here for transparency and reproducibility.

**Next:**
- Add static data files and basic UI components for tenants, products, and navigation.
- Integrate static data into each app and build out the main user flows.

---

## Step 6: Set Up Module Federation for Micro-Frontends

- Configured Webpack Module Federation in all apps:
	- `shell` loads `storefront` and `catalog` as remotes.
	- `storefront` and `catalog` expose their App components as remotes.
	- Shared React and ReactDOM as singletons across all apps.
- This enables independent development and deployment of micro-frontends, as required.

**Next:**
- Implement static data and user-friendly UI for each app.

---

## Step 5: Scaffold React Entry Points and Webpack Configs

- Created `src/index.jsx` and `public/index.html` for each app (`shell`, `storefront`, `catalog`).
- Added `webpack.config.js` for each app with Babel and HTML plugin, unique dev server ports.
- Each app now runs a basic React UI and is ready for further development and module federation setup.

**Next:**
- Set up Module Federation for micro-frontend loading.
- Implement static data and user-friendly UI for each app.

# Project Setup Plan: Multi-Tenant E-commerce Platform (Micro-Frontend, Static Data)

## Overview
This project is a modular React application using micro-frontend architecture (Webpack 5 Module Federation). It is designed to meet the requirements in the provided user stories and guidelines, with no backend and all data static.

## Structure
- `/apps/shell` - Main shell app (tenant routing, layout, shared navigation)
- `/apps/storefront` - Storefront builder micro-frontend (drag-and-drop, preview)
- `/apps/catalog` - Product catalog micro-frontend (static product data, bulk ops)
- `/shared` - Shared UI components, static data, and utilities

## Micro-Frontend Approach
- Each app is independently developed and built
- Shell app loads micro-frontends via module federation
- Static data is shared via the `/shared` package

## Key Features (MVP)
- Tenant switching (static list)
- Storefront builder UI (drag-and-drop, preview, templates)
- Product catalog UI (list, variants, bulk upload simulation)
- Routing between micro-frontends
- All data is static (JSON/JS files)

## Next Steps
1. Initialize monorepo and install dependencies
2. Scaffold shell and micro-frontend apps
3. Set up module federation
4. Implement static data and routing
5. Add sample UI and features
6. Document all progress in this file

*This file will be updated with each step and decision taken during the project setup and implementation.*

## Step 2: Initialize Monorepo and Install Dependencies

- Initialized npm project at root with `npm init -y`.
- Decided to use plain npm workspaces for monorepo management (no Lerna, as not required by requirements).
- Removed Lerna dependency.

**Next:**
- Configure npm workspaces in `package.json`.
- Create `apps` folder for micro-frontends.
- Install React, ReactDOM, Webpack 5, and other core dependencies for all apps.

---

*All steps are being documented for transparency and reproducibility.*

## Step 3: Configure npm Workspaces and Scaffold App Structure

	- `/apps/shell` (main shell app)
	- `/apps/storefront` (storefront builder micro-frontend)
	- `/apps/catalog` (product catalog micro-frontend)
	- `/shared` (shared UI, static data, utilities)

## Step 4: Install React, Webpack, and Babel in All Apps

- Installed React and ReactDOM in `shell`, `storefront`, and `catalog` apps.
- Installed Webpack 5, Webpack Dev Server, Babel, and related plugins in all apps.

**Next:**
- Scaffold basic React entry points and Webpack configs for each app.
- Set up Module Federation for micro-frontend loading.

- Install React, ReactDOM, Webpack 5, and other core dependencies in each app.
- Set up Module Federation for micro-frontend loading.
